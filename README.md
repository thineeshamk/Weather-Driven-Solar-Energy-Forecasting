# Weather-Driven-Solar-Energy-Forecasting
This is a machine learning project developed as part of a group research project for the BSc (Hons) in Data Science and Business Analytics at General Sir John Kotelawala Defence University.  The project focuses on building an accurate and efficient solar power output prediction system by using real-world operational and weather data.

## Project Overview

The main goal of this project is to forecast **short-term (15 minutes)** and **long-term (1 hour)** solar power output using machine learning techniques.

By integrating solar plant operational data with local weather data, the model helps:
- Improve energy planning
- Enhance power grid stability
- Reduce operational uncertainty
