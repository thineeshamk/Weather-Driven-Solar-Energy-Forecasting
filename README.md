# Weather-Driven Solar Energy Forecasting

This is a machine learning project developed as part of a group research project for the BSc (Hons) in Data Science and Business Analytics at General Sir John Kotelawala Defence University.

The project focuses on building an accurate and efficient solar power output prediction system for the **Vydexa Solar Power Plant** in Vavuniya, Sri Lanka, by using real-world operational and weather data.

---

## Project Overview

The main goal of this project is to forecast **short-term (15 minutes)** and **long-term (1 hour)** solar power output using machine learning techniques.

By integrating solar plant operational data with local weather data, the model helps:
- Improve energy planning
- Enhance power grid stability
- Reduce operational uncertainty

---

## Objectives

- Acquire and clean solar and weather datasets
- Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA)
- Train and evaluate ML models like:
  - Lasso Regression
  - Random Forest
  - XGBoost
  - LSTM (Neural Network)
- Deploy the best model using a simple interface (e.g., Streamlit)
